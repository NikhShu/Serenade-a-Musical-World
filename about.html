          Serenade's mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity - by
          giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their
          art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by
          it. We believe achieving this mission on our platform is made possible
          by welcoming different forms of artistic expression, ideas,
          perspectives, and voices. This may mean that some content on our
          platform may not be to each individual's liking or is content that
          Serenade endorses. <br />However, that doesn't mean that anything goes
          on our platform. In addition to the terms that you agreed to governing
          your use of our services, these rules help ensure that everyone has a
          safe and enjoyable experience.

        <p class="para">
          At Serenade we work hard to elevate creative expression and want our
          community to safely present their authentic selves, but that does not
          mean that anything goes. <br />Our long-standing Platform Rules
          outline what is and isn't allowed on Serenade. We prioritize the
          review of content that impacts minors, presents a greater risk of
          offline harm, or may be illegal.
